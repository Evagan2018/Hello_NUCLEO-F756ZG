# Hello example for NUCLEO-F756ZG

Simple Hello World example for STMicroelectronics [**NUCLEO-F756ZG**](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-F756ZG.html) development board.
This example prints "Hello World" and a counter value via the standard output which is routed to the debug console through Virtual COM port.

## Prerequisites

### Tools

- [CMSIS-Toolbox v2.13.0](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/releases) or newer
- [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with Keil Studio Pack extension (optional, alternatively CLI can be used)
- [Arm Compiler 6](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded) (automatically installed when using Visual Studio Code with vcpkg)

## Build Solution/Project

### Using Visual Studio Code with extensions

Required tools described in file 'vcpkg-configuration.json' should be automatically installed by vcpkg. You can see the status of vcpkg in the status bar.

Required CMSIS packs need to be also installed. In case a required pack is missing, a notification window will pop-up to install the missing pack.

Open the 'CMSIS' view from the side bar, select desired 'Build Type' and press the 'Build' button.

### Using Command Line Interface (CLI)

Download required packs (not required when the packs are already available) by executing the following commands:

```sh
csolution list packs -s hello.csolution.yml -m >packs.txt
cpackget update-index
cpackget add -f packs.txt
```

Build the project by executing the following command:

```sh
cbuild hello.csolution.yml
```
 
## Run the application

### On target hardware

- Connect the board's ST-LINK USB to the PC (provides also power).
- Open the 'Device Manager' view from the side bar:
  - Make sure your board is detected (the view should show 'ST-LINK').
  - Press the 'Open Serial' button next to the board name and select a baud rate of 115200.
- Open the 'CMSIS' view from the side bar:
  - Press the 'Run' button and wait until the image is programmed and starts running.
- Observe the terminal output.

### Using Drag-and-drop programming or external programmer and terminal

- Connect the board's ST-LINK USB to the PC (provides also power).
- Program the image (.hex) using Drag-and-drop programming or use external programmer.
- Open terminal on the PC and connect to the board's serial port with 115200 baud rate.
- Observe the terminal output.

### Simulation on AVH

- In a VS Code terminal, run:

  ```sh
  FVP_MPS2_Cortex-M7 --simlimit 10 -f fvp_config.txt -a out/hello_avh/avh/Debug/hello_avh.axf
  ```

## Debug the application on target hardware

Before starting to debug the application, make sure that you have gone through the steps as described in the
[run the application](#run-the-application) section.

### Using Visual Studio Code with extensions

Open the 'CMSIS' view from the side bar and press the 'Debug' button.
